Deductions
    5 points, if the application window does not show up at all, but we can fix the code to make it show. So make sure it actually shows when you run the application.
    5 points, if the application window cannot be closed, or it closes but does not terminate the application
    5 points, if you do not implement your main method in a class named SongLib (see Submission Instructions)
    5 points, if you have any code in the default package (directly under src) (see Submission Instructions)
    5 points, if you do not write your name at the top of all the files you submit.
    10 points, if the displayed list of songs is not in alphabetical order as specified in the Song list display item.
    10 points, if you did not use FXML for the UI design of the main window. (This does not apply to the pop-up dialogs to report input errors, or for confirming/canceling any of the add/edit/delete actions.)
    10 points, if any window other than the application frame pops up at any time (except for error dialogs for incorrect add and edit, if you choose to use dialogs for these, or dialogs for confirm/cancel of any action).
    10 points, if you use a table view anywhere in your UI.
    10 points, if you do not submit your implementation in a project zip file (see Submission Instructions) that can imported into Eclipse as a complete project

    Points will be deducted for each test case that cannot be tried because either your data file or your UI does not allow for testing it. The exact number of points will depend the point value of the test case(s).
    No credit, if you used any external libraries--you are only allowed to use the standard Java SDK, and optionally JSON (with permission from grader).
    No credit, if your program does not compile, or cannot be run. This is a course in software development, there is NO excuse to submit something that does not compile or does not run.
