Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
It was kind of weird.
Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel
weird and sad.  How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all
this nonsense, he thought, but that was something he was unable to
do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present
state couldn't get into that position. 
What a weird thing! He couldn't figure it out. His life was just one
big weird mess.
